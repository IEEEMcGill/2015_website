McGill IEEE Student Branch has arranged a visit to Ericsson Montreal. In this trip, we will visit Ericsson’s Emergency Response Team, which is responsible for maintaining large and highly available networks all over the world.</p><p>

 

They will actually be looking to hire new grads for the spring, so if you are about to graduate it would be an excellent opportunity for you. Bring your CV if you are looking for an internship, too. Since they can accommodate only a group of 12-15 people at time, the space is limited. As usual, registration is in a first-come, first-serve basis, with a priority for IEEE members.</p>
